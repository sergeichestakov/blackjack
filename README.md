# Interactive BlackJack CLI
Python program to play BlackJack in the terminal. Created by Sergei Chestakov.

## Instructions
My program requires Python 3.6 or higher to play.

In order to play the game, cd into the source directory and run:
```bash 
python3 blackjack.py
```
From there, simply follow the instructions and play alone or with one person until the game is over.
Rerun the script to play again!

To run the unit tests, from within the same directory simply run:
```bash
python3 test.py
```
